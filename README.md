## Final project for INST414 - Data Science Techniques

**Business Problem**:

Current detection tools for DCIS include mammograms that indicate whether or not a patient has DCIS, but there is a lack of tools that can correctly distinguish between low and high risk DCIS. As a result, many patients may receive too much or too little treatment, leading to unstable healthcare costs and increased patient anxiety. This project attempts to solve this problem using publicly available clinical data to accurately classify low, medium, and high risk DCIS patients.
